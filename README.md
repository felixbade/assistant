# Assistant â€“ Web UI for ChatGPT API

https://assistant.bloat.app

A mobile-friendly human interface for ChatGPT API. There is no back-end server, so you can easily host your own instance (see details below).

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for whatâ€™s new..

## ðŸ¤” Why API instead of ChatGPT Plus?
- `gpt-3.5-turbo`: **Cheap** token-based cost, instead of flat 20$/mo
- `gpt-4`: **Unlimited** requests (requires early access)
- **No logouts** â€“ if OpenAI started revoking API keys weekly, a lot of big SaaS products would get very angry
- **Private** â€“ OpenAIâ€™s API policy says your prompts wonâ€™t be used for developing, unlike in the playground.

## ðŸ”© Features
- Very polished, mobile-friendly UI
- PWA support: can be added to the phoneâ€™s home screen or installed on your computer as a Chrome app
- Requests go directly from the browser to OpenAI â€“ no backend server
- Settings and API key are stored in `localStorage`
- Unlimited conversation length by sending only x latest messages to the API (configurable)
- Markdown rendering
    - Bold, italic
    - Embedded links
    - Code keywords
    - Code blocks
    - Tables
    - Images
    - Horizontal lines
- Automatic dark/light theme
- Export the conversation as markdown
- Screenshot the whole conversation even if it doesn't fit the window
- Customize the assistantâ€™s behind-the-scenes system message prompt
- Send follow-up messages even before the previous answer is complete (processed in parallel)
- Change the model with ctrl+M
- Open Assistant with an initial prompt if you want to make integrations into other apps. Example: [https://assistant.bloat.app/#q=hello%20there](https://assistant.bloat.app/#q=hello%20there)

## ðŸšš In the future
- Search old chats with GPT embeddings (meaning your search words donâ€™t need to be an exact match)
- Speak your messages using the Whisper API

## ðŸ”§ Hosting your own version
- `npm install`
- `npm run build:prod`
- The bundle will go under `dist/`. Copy those files somewhere so they show up as a web page (for example GitHub Pages or Nginx).

## ðŸ’™ Contributing
The best way to contribute is by adding feature requests and bug reports to the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/felixbade/chatgpt-web-ui/issues) â€“ you donâ€™t need to be a programmer for that. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
